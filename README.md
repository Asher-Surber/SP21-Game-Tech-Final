# SP21-Game-Tech-Final
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme: Every Death Counts
We interpreted the theme as every enemy death adds to our overall score. However, we are pacifists and did not believe that our enemies deserve to die as their lives are important to us. Therefore, we made peace with them so that we can all live together in harmony.

## Game Play
Objective: Explore and try an find all the slimes :)
Game-play instructions: Move using WASD, shoot a magic missile using left click, jump using space.

## Impediments
We struggled with parsing errors and major conflicts for whatever reason in our game. We eventually had to revert to a version that was made a couple hours in the past, while only having 3 hours left.

## Implementation
Kenney.nl for assets (https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit), (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-suburban), (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/nature-kit)
original models
We included the feature of a magic blast, Music, and the ability to jump.
